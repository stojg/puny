It's that time in the week when 'A foreign affair' goes to the quiz-night at the Grands. We usually ends up at the bottom half in the results. This might be the result of the lack of knowledge we have in things not categorized in either technology, movies or music.

Sometimes we've been lucky enough to hit the second to last place, that given us a whopping $20 bar tab. Split that money on 4-5 people and we can almost get half a beer each.

Usually it's three europeans and one kiwi, but tonight we're getting some help from the french nation.
