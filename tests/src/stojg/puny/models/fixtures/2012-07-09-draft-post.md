Yesterday we had another movie night. We ended up watching Equlibrium and Chasing Amy.

Equilibrium is dystopian movie about a future society that have gotten rid of emotions by forcing citizens to inject chemicals paired with heavy indoctrination on how bad emotions are. The story is backed up with actions and "gun katas" to hide the fact that core elements of the story are taken from "Fahrenheit 451". Ray Bradbury who wrote the book sadly died just a few days ago. However I claim that the movie is a hidden gem and is far better than it looks. Fans of Christian "stone face" Bale will enjoy watching him wincing and crying when the bad guys executes dogs and "Emily Watson" alike.

Chasing Amy is in my opinion Kevin Smiths best movie. It's a great romantic comedy that has the same feeling and cast as most other Smith movies. The story is basically about a guy who falls in love with a lesbian girl. There's a lot of dialog and monologues that I had some problem following along in due to the lack of subtitles. But it's a great movie, watch it!
