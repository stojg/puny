The weather was so horrible tonight that we stayed in and watched a rented DVD - [The Three Musketeers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108333/) from 1993. Surprisingly, we wasn't forced to see a bunch of "You Wouldn't Steal a Car" warnings. It was a simpler time, but maybe not a better time.

It would be nice if at least the TV show producers, like HBO, could let me buy / rent episodes TV shows. It's just idiotic having us consumers wait until the DVD box is rentable (+1 year) or pay for shit we don't want to see (paid cable). No wonder people download what they can't get buy even paying.

This morning I discovered that there are a site for telling HBO about how much you would like to pay for their services: [Take My Money, HBO!](http://takemymoneyhbo.com/)
